This paper explores the theoretical and ethical implications of artificially induced cognitive bifurcation—cases where memory and identity are selectively partitioned. Drawing from contemporary discussions on split-brain patients and personal identity theory, I argue that such partitioning, while functionally useful, undermines coherent moral agency. The work raises concerns about the autonomy of selves that emerge under institutional control and suggests criteria for evaluating responsibility across partitioned states.

abstract = """
This article examines the concept of the 'workplace self' as a socially embedded cognitive construct shaped by institutional demands and role expectations. Drawing on the extended mind hypothesis and theories of performative identity, I argue that the workplace self operates as an outsourced cognitive agent—optimized for local utility but epistemically constrained. Implications for authenticity, agency, and institutional ethics are discussed.
